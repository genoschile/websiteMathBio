    "resume": "Visualizing genomic data in chromosomal context can help detecting errors in data processing and may suggest new hypotheses to be tested. Here, we report a new tool for displaying large and diverse genomic data along chromosomes. The software is implemented in R so that  visualization can be easily integrated with its numerous packages for processing genomic data. It supports simultaneous visualization of multiple tracks of data. Large genomic regions such as QTLs or synteny tracts may be shown along histograms of number of genes, genetic variants, or any other type of genomic element. Tracks can also contain values for continuous or categorical variables and the user can choose among points, connected lines, colored segments, or histograms for representing data. chromPlot takes data from tables in data.frame in GRanges formats. The information necessary to draw chromosomes for mouse and human is included with the package. For other organisms, chromPlot can read Gap and cytoBandIdeo tables from the UCSC Genome Browser. We present common use cases here, and a full tutorial is included as the package’s vignette.",

    "resume": "Chargaff’s second parity rule holds that for each of the two DNA strands in a genome, the %A is similar to %T and %G is similar to %C. Although the validity of the second rule is still in debate and the biological cause is unknown, a generalized form of the second parity rule has already been proposed. The generalization states that the frequency of a string of a particular length is similar to the frequency of its reverse complement in the same strand. In a previous work, we have developed a statistical hypothesis test for the generalized second Chargaff parity rule for any particular string in a genome. One obstacle to test all available genomes with this statistical test was the efficiency of the computational implementation. In this work, we circumvent this issue, implementing our statistical test in an efficient and multi-processing computer program. The development was carried out in Python, using packets for handling sequences in FASTA format and the required calculations. For each input genome, a database SQLite is generated holding the absolute frequencies of all existing strings in the genome up to a user defined length, and their reverse complements. Multiple sequences are accepted as input, each sequence being analyzed in one CPU. Thus, a bacterial genome, ~4M characters, with 4 sequences takes about 14 seconds to process entirely in 4 CPUs. This computer program will allow our test to be carried out in all available completely sequenced genomes and assess the validity of Chargaff’s second parity rule and its generalized version.",

Here, we abstract from the statistical methods used for genetic mapping, which are dependent on the specific resource being used, i.e. F2, RILs, or outbred populations among others. We use a public dataset with results from a mouse eQTL experiment for three examples of visualization: genome-wide dot plots of marker-by-gene association, karyotype-like plots, and circos plots. Dot plots give a first overview of the results from eQTL mapping, allowing detecting genome-wide patterns of cis- and trans-genetic association to transcription level. Karyotype-like plots provide chromosomal context and allow integrating multiple tracks of information in a single plot. Circos plots can, in addition, display long-range interactions to provide an overview of genetic connectivity at the genome level. All examples are developed and explained using R code, an open-source language with powerful statistical and graphical capabilities. The principles reviewed here, however, can be applied with other software options, organisms, and to any type of molecular phenotype that can be assigned to a genomic position.",

    "resume": "In the 40’s, Erwin Chargaff was the first to observe the parity between Adenines (A) and Timinies (T) and Citosines (C) and Guanines (G), in the molecule of DNA. In the 60’s, Chargaff found a second parity rule. This time in a single strand of DNA. The amounts of A’s and T’s, and the amounts of C’s and G’s is similar. The explanation of the first rule is the complementary nature of the double stranded helix of the DNA molecule. However, for the 2nd rule, a biological explanation has remained a mystery. In the last 40 years, a generalization of the second rule was proposed, to explain the 2nd rule as a particular case. This generalization states that for any given k-mer and its reverse complement (RC), the number of times both are found is similar in a single strand of DNA. Two measures have been proposed to test the generalized Chargaff’s 2nd rule (gC2r), both include an artifact regarding the length of the genomes. This has led the authors to think there is a minimum length of a genome and a maximum k-mer for compliance. We propose a new way to measure the compliance of any given genome to the gC2r. The measure is the proportion of the genome which complies with gC2r. The compliance is measured per pair of kmer/k-merRC, using the natural logarithm of the number of times the k-mer is found, divided by the number of times its reverse complement is found in the genome or ln(#k-mer/k-merRC). This measure is independent of the size of the analyzed k-mer and the size of the genome. This measure has been implemented in a software, ChargaffCracker, which can rapidly analyze sequences and deliver a statistical report. We have generated random genomes based on the proportions and lengths of biological prokaryote genome sequences and compared them. We conclude hypothesizing that: 1. The compliance of the gC2r is a consequence, not cause of the 2nd rule and; 2. Although Chargaff’s 2nd rule might be a consequence of transpositions and inversions, the limits of compliance of the gC2r is a property of the sequence model of genomes, not of the biology of organisms. However, this property might have been selected to fulfill biological needs in genome evolution.",

    "resume": "Recent work suggests that certain places can be more attractive for car theft based how many people regularly visit them, as well as other factors. In this sense, we must also consider the city or district itself where vehicles are stolen. All cities have different cultural and socioeconomic characteristics that influence car theft patterns. In particular, the distribution of public services and places attract a large crowd could play a key role in the occurrence of car theft. Santiago, a city that displays drastic socioeconomic differences among its districts, presents increasingly-high car theft rates. This represents a serious issue for the city, as for any other major city, which –at least for Santiago– has not been analyzed in depth using quantitative approaches. In this work, we present a preliminary study of how places that create social interest, such as restaurants, bars, schools, and shopping malls, increase car theft frequency in Santiago. We also study if some types of places are more attractive than others for this type of crime. To evaluate this, we propose to analyze car theft points (CTP) from insurance companies and their relationship with places of social interest (PSI) extracted from Google Maps, using a proximity based approach. Our findings show a high correlation between CTP and PSI for all of the social interest categories that we studied in the different districts of the Santiago. In particular our work contributes to the understanding of the social factors that are associated to car thefts.",

This database is an invaluable resource for researchers in the biological field, which classifies enzyme-related information in categories that are very useful to obtain specific functional and protein engineering information for enzyme families. However, the BRENDA web interface, the most used by researchers with a non-informatic background, does not allow the user to cross-reference data from different categories or sub-categories in the database. Obtaining information in an easy and fast way, in a friendly web interface, without the necessity to have a deep informatics knowledge, will facilitate and improve research in the enzymology and protein engineering field. Results: We developed the Brenda Easy Search Tool (BEST), an interactive Shiny/R application that enables querying the BRENDA database for complex cross-tabulated characteristics, and retrieving enzyme-related parameters and information readily and efficiently, which can be used for the study of enzyme function or as an input for other bioinformatics tools.",

In this work, we explored genomic drivers of contagion in Chile. We sequenced 3443 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected between January and July 2021, where the Gamma (P.1), Lambda (C.37), Alpha (B.1.1.7), B.1.1.348, and B.1.1 lineages were predominant. Using a Bayesian model tailored for limited genomic surveillance, we found that Lambda and Gamma variants’ reproduction numbers were about 5% and 16% larger than Alpha’s, respectively. We observed an overabundance of mutations in the Spike gene, strongly correlated with the variant’s transmissibility. Furthermore, the variants’ mutational signatures featured a breakpoint concurrent with the beginning of vaccination (mostly CoronaVac, an inactivated virus vaccine), indicating an additional putative selective pressure. Thus, our work provides a reliable method for quantifying novel variants’ transmissibility under subsampling (as newly-reported Delta, B.1.617.2) and highlights the importance of continuous genomic surveillance.",

A prospective lon-gitudinal study of 70 wounds from 15 severe EB patients (Junctional and Reces-sive Dystrophic EB) from Chile. Wounds were selected independently of theirinfected status. Wound cultures, including bacterial species identification, compo-sition and Staphylococcus aureus (SA) antibiotic susceptibility were registered.Wounds were separated into categories according to their healing capacity, recog-nising chronic, and healing wounds. Hundred-one of the 102 wound cultureswere positive for bacterial growth. From these, 100 were SA-positive; 31 wereresistant to Ciprofloxacin (31%) and only seven were methicillin-resistant SA (7%).Ciprofloxacin-resistant SA was found significantly predominant in chronicwounds (**P < .01). Interestingly, atoxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae(CD) was identified and found to be the second most abundant recovered bacteria(31/101), present almost always in combination with SA (30/31). CD was only found in Recessive Dystrophic EB patients and not related to wound chronicity.Other less frequent bacterial species found included Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Streptococus spp. and Proteus spp. Infection was negatively associated with thehealing status of wounds.",

    "resume": "Genomic surveillance of infectious diseases allows monitoring circulating and emerging variants and quantifying their epidemic potential. However, due to the high costs associated with genomic sequencing, only a limited number of samples can be analysed. Thus, it is critical to understand how sampling impacts the information generated. Here, we combine a compartmental model for the spread of COVID-19 (distinguishing several SARS-CoV-2 variants) with different sampling strategies to assess their impact on genomic surveillance. In particular, we compare adaptive sampling, i.e., dynamically reallocating resources between screening at points of entry and inside communities, and constant sampling, i.e., assigning fixed resources to the two locations. We show that adaptive sampling uncovers new variants up to five weeks earlier than constant sampling, significantly reducing detection delays and estimation errors. This advantage is most prominent at low sequencing rates. Although increasing the sequencing rate has a similar effect, the marginal benefits of doing so may not always justify the associated costs. Consequently, it is convenient for countries with comparatively few resources to operate at lower sequencing rates, thereby profiting the most from adaptive sampling. Finally, our methodology can be readily adapted to study undersampling in other dynamical systems.",

Little is known about the impact of bacterial composition and susceptibility in wound resolution, and there is a need for longitudinal studies to understand healing outcomes with different types of bacterial colonisation. A prospective longitudinal study of 70 wounds from 15 severe EB patients (Junctional and Recessive Dystrophic EB) from Chile. Wounds were selected independently of their infected status. Wound cultures, including bacterial species identification, composition and Staphylococcus aureus (SA) antibiotic susceptibility were registered. Wounds were separated into categories according to their healing capacity, recognising chronic, and healing wounds. Hundred-one of the 102 wound cultures were positive for bacterial growth. From these, 100 were SA-positive; 31 were resistant to Ciprofloxacin (31%) and only seven were methicillin-resistant SA (7%). Ciprofloxacin-resistant SA was found significantly predominant in chronic wounds (**P < .01). Interestingly, atoxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae (CD) was identified and found to be the second most abundant recovered bacteria (31/101), present almost always in combination with SA (30/31). CD was only found in Recessive Dystrophic EB patients and not related to wound chronicity. Other less frequent bacterial species found included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococus spp. and Proteus spp. Infection was negatively associated with the healing status of wounds.",

For Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) there are clear differences in both the clinical presentation and the tumor genomic profiles between smokers and never-smokers. For example, the Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) histological subtype in never-smokers is predominately found in young women of European, North American, and Asian descent. While the clinical presentation and tumor genomic profiles of smokers have been widely examined, never-smokers are usually underrepresented, especially those of a Latin American (LA) background.

A low response to therapy in breast cancer (BC) is a significant contributor to mortality. However, it remains unclear if there is an association between A>I(G) RNA-edited sites and sensitivity to genotoxic drugs. To address this issue, we employed a stringent bioinformatics approach to identify differentially RNA-edited sites (DESs) associated with low or high sensitivity (FDR 0.1, log2 fold change 2.5) according to the IC50 of PARP inhibitors, anthracyclines, and alkylating agents using WGS/RNA-seq data in BC cell lines. We then validated these findings in patients with basal subtype BC. These DESs are mainly located in non-coding regions, but a lesser proportion in coding regions showed predicted deleterious consequences. Notably, some of these DESs are previously reported as oncogenic variants, and in genes related to DNA damage repair, drug metabolism, gene regulation, the cell cycle, and immune response. In patients with BC, we uncovered DESs predominantly in immune response genes, and a subset with a significant association (log-rank test p < 0.05) between RNA editing level in LSR, SMPDL3B, HTRA4, and LL22NC03-80A10.6 genes, and progression-free survival. Our findings provide a landscape of RNA-edited sites that may be involved in drug response mechanisms, highlighting the value of A>I(G) RNA editing in clinical outcomes for BC.",

In this work, we develop a Bayesian framework to quantify the relative transmissibility of different variants tailored for regions with limited GS. We use it to study the relative transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Chile. Among the 3443 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected between January and June 2021, where sampling was designed to be representative, the Gamma (P.1), Lambda (C.37), Alpha (B.1.1.7), B.1.1.348, and B.1.1 lineages were predominant. We found that Lambda and Gamma variants’ reproduction numbers were 5% (95% CI: [1%, 14%]) and 16% (95% CI: [11%, 21%]) larger than Alpha’s, respectively. Besides, we observed a systematic mutation enrichment in the Spike gene for all circulating variants, which strongly correlated with variants’ transmissibility during the studied period (r = 0.93, p-value = 0.025). We also characterised the mutational signatures of local samples and their evolution over time and with the progress of vaccination, comparing them with those of samples collected in other regions worldwide. Altogether, our work provides a reliable method for quantifying variant transmissibility under subsampling and emphasises the importance of continuous genomic surveillance.",

    "resume": "Tobacco use is one of the main risk factors for Lung Cancer (LC) development. However, about 10–20% of those diagnosed with the disease are never-smokers. For Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) there are clear differences in both the clinical presentation and the tumor genomic profiles between smokers and never-smokers. For example, the Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) histological subtype in never-smokers is predominately found in young women of European, North American, and Asian descent. While the clinical presentation and tumor genomic profiles of smokers have been widely examined, never-smokers are usually underrepresented, especially those of a Latin American (LA) background. In this work, we characterize, for the first time, the difference in the genomic profiles between smokers and never-smokers LC patients from Chile.",

    "resume": "Cancers of unknown primary (CUP) are a heterogeneous group of aggressive metastatic cancers where standardised diagnostic techniques fail to identify the organ where it originated, resulting in a poor prognosis and resistance to treatment. Recent advances in large-scale sequencing techniques have enabled the identification of mutational signatures specific to particular tumour subtypes, even from liquid biopsy samples such as blood. This breakthrough paves the way for the development of new cost-effective diagnostic strategies. This mini-review explores recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) and its application to tumour classification methods for CUP patients, identifying its weaknesses and strengths when classifying the tumour type. In the era of multi-omics, integrating several sources of information (e.g., imaging, molecular biomarkers, and family history) requires important theoretical advancements: increasing the dimensionality of the problem can result in lowering the predictive accuracy and robustness when data is scarce. Here, we review and discuss different architectures and strategies for incorporating cutting-edge machine learning into CUP diagnosis, aiming to bridge the gap between theory and clinical practice.",
